The “countdown” function. This function should begin at the “start” variable, which is an integer that is passed to the function,  and count down to 0. Complete the code so that a function call like “countdown(2)” will return the numbers “2,1,0”.

def countdown(start):
    x = start
    if x > 0:
        return_string = "Counting down to 0: "
        while x>=0: # Complete the while loop
            return_string+=str(x)# Add the numbers to the "return_string"
            if x > 0:
                return_string += ","
            x-=1 # Decrement the appropriate variable
    else:
        return_string = "Cannot count down to 0"
    return return_string


print(countdown(10)) # Should be "Counting down to 0: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0"
print(countdown(2)) # Should be "Counting down to 0: 2,1,0"
print(countdown(0)) # Should be "Cannot count down to 0"
